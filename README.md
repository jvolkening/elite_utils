# thermo_utils

This repository contains the `Thermo::Handler` platform for managing data flow from a Thermo mass spectrometer.
The tools are undergoing active development, are relatively undocumented, and are in the alpha testing stage.
Use at your own risk.

More extensive documentation will be added soon.
